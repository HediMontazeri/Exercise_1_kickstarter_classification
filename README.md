# Exercise_1_kickstarter_classification
This exercise includes two parts. First part is data exploration which only looks at type of features, tries to gain insight and uncover relations in the data. Also some new features are built. Such as time interval between deadlime and launch time. 
The second part tries different methods to predict the new state. 

First method is linear SVM, although based on correlations, chance of success of this method is too low. Accuracy of this method is
Second method is decision tree with accuracy of

Last method is neural network. Tensorflow and keras are being imported to build the neural network. The best model has the following structure:
